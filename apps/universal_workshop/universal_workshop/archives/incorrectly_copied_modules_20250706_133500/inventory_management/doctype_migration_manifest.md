# Inventory Management DocType Migration Manifest
**P3.5.4 - Inventory & Parts Module Consolidation**

## Migration Overview
This manifest documents the comprehensive migration of DocTypes from three source modules into the unified `inventory_management` module while preserving all Arabic cultural components and Islamic business compliance.

### Source Modules Being Consolidated
1. **parts_inventory/** (7 DocTypes) - Core inventory operations
2. **scrap_management/** (26 DocTypes) - Dismantling and parts recovery
3. **marketplace_integration/** (3 DocTypes) - External marketplace synchronization

**Total DocTypes:** 36 â†’ Enhanced unified inventory management system
