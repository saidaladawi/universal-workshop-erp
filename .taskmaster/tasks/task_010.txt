# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Scrap Management and Vehicle Dismantling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Build comprehensive scrap vehicle management with condition assessment, parts extraction planning, and sales integration
# Details:
Create Scrap Vehicle DocType with acquisition details and condition assessment workflows. Implement virtual disassembly planning system with parts extraction optimization and labor time estimation. Build parts condition grading system with quality certification and photographic documentation. Create storage location management with barcode tracking for extracted parts. Develop sales channel integration for online marketplaces and offline sales with real-time availability updates. Implement profit analysis with ROI calculation and market trend analysis for pricing optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Verify vehicle assessment completion within 30 minutes, test virtual disassembly parts list accuracy, validate parts grading consistency, confirm sales integration updates availability across channels in real-time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Scrap Vehicle DocType with Acquisition and Condition Assessment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the core Scrap Vehicle DocType to manage vehicle acquisition details and implement comprehensive condition assessment workflows with standardized evaluation criteria.
### Details:
Create DocType with fields for vehicle identification (VIN, make, model, year), acquisition details (source, cost, date), and condition assessment forms. Implement workflow states (Acquired, Assessment In Progress, Assessment Complete, Ready for Dismantling). Add custom fields for damage assessment, component condition ratings, and assessor information. Include photo upload functionality for documentation.

## 2. Implement Virtual Disassembly Planning System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Build an intelligent disassembly planning system that optimizes parts extraction sequences, estimates labor time, and provides step-by-step dismantling instructions based on vehicle condition assessment.
### Details:
Create Disassembly Plan DocType linked to Scrap Vehicle. Implement algorithm to generate optimal extraction sequence based on part value, condition, and accessibility. Add labor time estimation using predefined time standards per component type. Create interactive dismantling checklist with progress tracking. Include safety warnings and required tools for each step.

## 3. Build Parts Condition Grading and Documentation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop a comprehensive parts grading system with standardized quality certification, photographic documentation, and condition-based pricing recommendations.
### Details:
Create Extracted Parts DocType with condition grading fields (Grade A-D scale), quality certification workflow, and multi-photo documentation. Implement automated pricing suggestions based on condition grade and market data. Add quality control checkpoints and inspector assignment. Include barcode generation for each extracted part and integration with condition assessment data from disassembly process.

## 4. Create Storage Location Management with Barcode Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive warehouse management system for extracted parts with barcode tracking, location optimization, and real-time inventory management.
### Details:
Create Storage Location and Inventory Movement DocTypes. Implement barcode scanning functionality for part check-in/check-out. Add location optimization algorithm to suggest optimal storage based on part size, weight, and turnover rate. Create mobile-friendly interface for warehouse staff. Include inventory alerts for fast-moving parts and storage capacity management.

## 5. Develop Sales Channel Integration and Profit Analysis System [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Build integrated sales management system connecting to online marketplaces and offline sales channels with real-time availability updates, plus comprehensive profit analysis with ROI calculation and market trend analysis.
### Details:
Create Sales Channel DocType with marketplace API integrations (eBay, Amazon, local platforms). Implement real-time inventory synchronization and automated listing creation with photos and condition details. Build profit analysis dashboard with ROI calculations, cost tracking (acquisition, labor, storage), and market trend analysis. Add pricing optimization recommendations based on historical sales data and market conditions.
