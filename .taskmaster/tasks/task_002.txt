# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement License Management and Security Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build comprehensive license management system with business binding, hardware fingerprinting, and anti-resale protection
# Details:
Develop JWT-based authentication using RS256 algorithm with 24-hour validation cycles. Implement hardware fingerprinting using system MAC addresses, CPU serial numbers, and motherboard IDs. Create business name binding system supporting Arabic and English with owner verification through government database integration. Build offline grace period management allowing 24-hour operation without connectivity. Implement suspicious activity detection using behavioral analysis and geographic location tracking. Create comprehensive audit logging with tamper-proof integrity using cryptographic hashing.

# Test Strategy:
Test hardware fingerprinting accuracy (99.9% target), validate 24-hour offline operation, verify business binding prevents unauthorized changes, confirm audit trail integrity and tamper detection capabilities.
