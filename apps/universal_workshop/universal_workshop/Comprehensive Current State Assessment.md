  📋 Critical Discrepancies & Recommendations

  🚨 IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

  1. Billing Management Crisis

  Issue: Complete absence of DocType definitions despite extensive utility code
  Impact: Cannot process invoices, VAT, or payments
  Action: Emergency DocType creation in Week 1

  2. Parts Inventory Foundation Gap

  Issue: Missing core Part DocType and inventory structures
  Impact: Cannot manage automotive parts inventory
  Action: Immediate DocType implementation in Week 3

  3. Frontend V2 Build Gap

  Issue: No build artifacts generated, cannot deploy modern frontend
  Impact: Users stuck with legacy interface
  Action: Run build process and resolve integration issues

  🔧 ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

  1. API Standardization

  // Recommended API pattern:
  interface UniversalWorkshopAPI {
    create(doctype: string, data: any): Promise<DocResponse>
    read(doctype: string, name: string): Promise<DocResponse>
    update(doctype: string, name: string, data: any): Promise<DocResponse>
    delete(doctype: string, name: string): Promise<void>
    list(doctype: string, filters?: any): Promise<ListResponse>
  }

  2. Testing Framework

  # Required test structure:
  tests/
  ├── unit/           # Individual DocType tests
  ├── integration/    # Module interaction tests  
  ├── api/           # API endpoint tests
  ├── frontend/      # Vue.js component tests
  └── e2e/          # End-to-end workflow tests

  3. Documentation Requirements

  Required Documentation:
  ├── API Documentation (auto-generated from code)
  ├── Component Library Documentation
  ├── Arabic/RTL Development Guide
  ├── Migration Guide (Legacy to V2)
  └── Deployment and Operations Manual
