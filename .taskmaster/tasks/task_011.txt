# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Data Migration and Legacy System Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive data migration tools with validation and mapping for legacy system integration
# Details:
Develop data migration framework supporting CSV, Excel, and database imports with field mapping and validation. Create data cleansing tools for customer, vehicle, and parts information with duplicate detection and merging. Implement validation rules ensuring 100% data integrity with comprehensive error reporting. Build rollback capabilities for failed migrations with transaction logging. Create mapping tools for legacy system field alignment with ERPNext schema. Develop progress tracking and status reporting for large data migrations.

# Test Strategy:
Validate 100% of imported records with error reporting, test data cleansing accuracy and duplicate detection, verify rollback capabilities for failed migrations, confirm mapping tool accuracy for legacy system integration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Build Core Data Migration Framework with Multi-Format Support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational data migration framework that supports importing from CSV, Excel, and database sources with configurable field mapping capabilities
### Details:
Create a modular framework with adapters for different data sources (CSV, Excel, SQL databases). Implement a configuration-driven field mapping system that allows users to map source fields to ERPNext schema fields. Build parsers for each format with proper encoding handling and data type conversion. Include support for batch processing and memory-efficient streaming for large datasets.

## 2. Implement Data Validation and Cleansing Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create comprehensive data validation rules and cleansing tools specifically for customer, vehicle, and parts information with duplicate detection and merging capabilities
### Details:
Build validation engine with configurable rules for data integrity checks (required fields, format validation, business logic constraints). Implement duplicate detection algorithms using fuzzy matching for customer names, exact matching for vehicle VINs, and part number standardization. Create automated and manual merge workflows with conflict resolution interfaces. Include data standardization tools for addresses, phone numbers, and part descriptions.

## 3. Develop Transaction Management and Rollback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Build robust transaction logging and rollback capabilities to handle failed migrations with complete audit trails and recovery mechanisms
### Details:
Implement transaction logging that captures all data changes during migration with timestamps and user tracking. Create rollback mechanisms that can reverse partial or complete migrations while maintaining referential integrity. Build checkpoint system for large migrations allowing resume from failure points. Include comprehensive error logging with detailed failure reasons and affected records.

## 4. Create Legacy System Field Mapping and Schema Alignment Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Build intelligent mapping tools that align legacy system fields with ERPNext schema, including data transformation and custom field creation capabilities
### Details:
Develop schema analysis tools that can inspect legacy databases and suggest field mappings to ERPNext. Create transformation engine for data format conversions (date formats, currency, units). Build custom field creation workflow for legacy fields that don't exist in standard ERPNext. Include mapping templates for common legacy systems and reusable mapping configurations.

## 5. Build Migration Progress Tracking and Reporting Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Create comprehensive progress tracking system with real-time status reporting, error summaries, and migration analytics for large-scale data migrations
### Details:
Build real-time dashboard showing migration progress with record counts, success/failure rates, and estimated completion times. Create detailed error reporting with categorization and resolution suggestions. Implement notification system for migration completion and critical errors. Include post-migration analytics comparing source vs migrated data volumes and identifying potential issues.
