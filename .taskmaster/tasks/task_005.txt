# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Parts Inventory Management with Barcode Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build comprehensive parts catalog with real-time inventory tracking, barcode scanning, and automated reordering
# Details:
Extend ERPNext Item and Stock modules for automotive parts with cross-reference lookup and compatibility matrix. Implement barcode/QR code integration using ZXing library for mobile scanning. Build multi-location stock management with transfer workflows between service bays and storage areas. Create automated reorder point calculation using historical consumption data and lead times. Develop supplier performance tracking with price comparison tools and delivery metrics. Implement demand forecasting algorithm using moving averages and seasonal adjustments.

# Test Strategy:
Verify parts search results under 2 seconds, test barcode scanning 99.9% accuracy with real-time inventory updates, validate automated reorder alerts at predefined levels, confirm inventory accuracy above 98% through cycle counting.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend ERPNext Item and Stock Modules for Automotive Parts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Customize ERPNext Item doctype to include automotive-specific fields and create cross-reference lookup system with compatibility matrix for parts interchange
### Details:
Create custom fields in Item doctype for OEM part numbers, vehicle compatibility (make/model/year), part categories, and cross-reference numbers. Build compatibility matrix table linking parts to vehicle specifications. Implement search functionality for parts lookup by vehicle or cross-reference numbers. Extend Stock Entry and Stock Ledger to handle automotive-specific tracking requirements.

## 2. Implement Barcode/QR Code Integration with Mobile Scanning [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Integrate ZXing library for barcode scanning capabilities in mobile interface and desktop application for inventory operations
### Details:
Install and configure ZXing library for barcode/QR code generation and scanning. Create mobile-responsive scanning interface using camera API. Build barcode generation for new parts with configurable formats (Code 128, QR codes). Implement scan-to-search functionality for quick part lookup and stock transactions. Add barcode printing capabilities for labels and tags.

## 3. Build Multi-Location Stock Management with Transfer Workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create comprehensive stock management system supporting multiple storage locations with automated transfer workflows between service bays and storage areas
### Details:
Extend Warehouse doctype to support location hierarchies (main storage, service bays, mobile units). Build stock transfer workflows with approval processes and tracking. Implement location-based stock allocation and reservation system. Create mobile interface for technicians to request parts transfers. Add real-time stock visibility across all locations with low-stock alerts per location.

## 4. Create Automated Reorder Point Calculation and Supplier Performance Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Develop intelligent reordering system using historical consumption data and implement comprehensive supplier performance monitoring with price comparison tools
### Details:
Build reorder point calculation engine using historical consumption patterns, lead times, and safety stock requirements. Create supplier performance tracking system monitoring delivery times, quality metrics, and pricing trends. Implement automated purchase requisition generation when stock hits reorder points. Build price comparison dashboard showing supplier pricing history and market analysis. Add supplier scorecards with delivery performance and quality ratings.

## 5. Implement Demand Forecasting Algorithm with Seasonal Adjustments [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Develop advanced demand forecasting system using moving averages and seasonal adjustment algorithms to predict future parts requirements
### Details:
Implement moving average algorithms (simple, weighted, exponential) for demand forecasting. Build seasonal adjustment factors based on historical patterns and automotive service cycles. Create forecasting dashboard showing predicted demand trends and confidence intervals. Integrate forecasting results with reorder point calculations for dynamic inventory optimization. Add machine learning capabilities for improved prediction accuracy over time.
