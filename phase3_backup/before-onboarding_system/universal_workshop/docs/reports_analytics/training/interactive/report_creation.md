---

## Step 3: Field Selection and Organization

### Your Mission
Select and organize the data fields that will appear in your report.

### Instructions

1. **Essential Fields to Include**
   
   From the "Available Fields" panel, drag these fields to "Selected Fields":
   
   | Priority | Field Name | Display Name | Purpose |
   |----------|------------|--------------|---------|
   | 1 | `customer` | Customer Name | Identify customer |
   | 2 | `posting_date` | Invoice Date | Date reference |
   | 3 | `name` | Invoice Number | Invoice ID |
   | 4 | `total` | Total Amount | Revenue value |
   | 5 | `status` | Status | Payment status |
   | 6 | `territory` | Territory | Regional analysis |
   | 7 | `sales_partner` | Sales Partner | Salesperson tracking |

2. **Field Organization**
   - **Reorder fields** by dragging them up/down in the "Selected Fields" panel
   - **Suggested order**: Customer → Date → Invoice → Amount → Status → Territory → Partner

3. **Field Formatting**
   - Click on "Total Amount" field
   - Set format to "Currency (OMR)"
   - Enable "Show Totals" option
   - Click on "Invoice Date" field
   - Set format to "DD/MM/YYYY"

### 💡 Interactive Exercise
**Test Your Understanding**: 
Which field would you add if you wanted to track which services generated the most revenue?

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>
You would add the "Items" table field or create a linked report to "Sales Invoice Item" to see individual services.
</details>

### ✅ Checkpoint
You should have 7 fields in your "Selected Fields" panel, properly ordered and formatted.

---

## Step 4: Filters and Conditions

### Your Mission
Add intelligent filters to make your report dynamic and useful.

### Instructions

1. **Date Range Filter**
   ```
   Filter Type: Date Range
   Field: Invoice Date
   Default: Current Month
   User Editable: Yes
   Label: Select Date Range
   ```

2. **Status Filter**
   ```
   Filter Type: Select
   Field: Status
   Options: Paid, Unpaid, Overdue
   Default: Paid
   Multiple Selection: Yes
   Label: Invoice Status
   ```

3. **Customer Type Filter**
   ```
   Filter Type: Link
   Field: Customer
   Allow Multiple: Yes
   Label: Select Customers
   ```

4. **Territory Filter**
   ```
   Filter Type: Select
   Field: Territory
   Default: All Territories
   Label: Business Territory
   ```

### 🎯 Advanced Technique
Create a "Quick Filters" section by grouping related filters together. This makes the report more user-friendly.

### 🧠 Think About It
**Question**: Why should the date range filter be user-editable?
**Answer**: Different users may need different time periods for analysis - daily operations vs. monthly planning vs. annual review.

### ✅ Checkpoint
Your report should now have 4 well-configured filters that make the report flexible for different use cases.

---

## Step 5: Sorting and Grouping

### Your Mission
Configure how data is organized and presented in your report.

### Instructions

1. **Primary Sorting**
   ```
   Sort Field: Invoice Date
   Sort Order: Descending (Newest First)
   Priority: 1
   ```

2. **Secondary Sorting**
   ```
   Sort Field: Total Amount
   Sort Order: Descending (Highest First)
   Priority: 2
   ```

3. **Grouping Configuration**
   ```
   Group By: Territory
   Show Group Totals: Yes
   Group Sort: By Total Revenue
   Expand Groups: Yes
   ```

4. **Summary Statistics**
   - ✅ Enable "Show Grand Total"
   - ✅ Enable "Show Record Count"
   - ✅ Enable "Show Average"
   - ✅ Enable "Show Percentage Distribution"

### 📊 Visualization Preview
Your report will now show:
- Invoices grouped by territory
- Within each territory, sorted by date (newest first)
- Revenue totals for each territory
- Grand totals at the bottom

### ✅ Checkpoint
Click "Preview" button to see your grouped and sorted data. You should see clear territorial groupings with totals.

---

## Step 6: Visualizations and Charts

### Your Mission
Add compelling visualizations to make your data more understandable.

### Instructions

1. **Revenue Trend Chart**
   ```
   Chart Type: Line Chart
   X-Axis: Invoice Date (grouped by week)
   Y-Axis: Total Amount
   Title: Weekly Revenue Trend
   Position: Top of report
   ```

2. **Territory Distribution**
   ```
   Chart Type: Pie Chart
   Data: Territory vs Total Revenue
   Title: Revenue by Territory
   Show Percentages: Yes
   Position: After summary
   ```

3. **Top Customers Chart**
   ```
   Chart Type: Bar Chart
   X-Axis: Customer Name (top 10)
   Y-Axis: Total Revenue
   Title: Top 10 Customers by Revenue
   Orientation: Horizontal
   ```

4. **Status Distribution**
   ```
   Chart Type: Donut Chart
   Data: Status vs Count
   Title: Invoice Status Distribution
   Colors: Green (Paid), Red (Unpaid), Orange (Overdue)
   ```

### 🎨 Design Tips
- Use consistent colors across all charts
- Keep chart titles clear and descriptive
- Ensure charts are readable on mobile devices
- Consider colorblind accessibility

### 🤔 Interactive Challenge
**Scenario**: Your manager wants to quickly see which territory is performing best this month. Which chart type would be most effective?

<details>
<summary>Click for recommendation</summary>
A bar chart or column chart would be best because it allows easy comparison of values across territories. Pie charts are better for showing proportions of a whole.
</details>

### ✅ Checkpoint
Your report should now include 4 different visualizations that provide comprehensive insights into sales performance.

---

## Step 7: Preview and Testing

### Your Mission
Test your report thoroughly to ensure it works correctly with different data scenarios.

### Instructions

1. **Basic Preview Test**

2. **Filter Testing**
   - Test each filter individually:
     - Change date range and verify data updates
     - Select different territories and confirm filtering
     - Try different status combinations
   - Test multiple filters together

3. **Mobile Responsiveness Test**
   - Click "Mobile Preview" button
   - Check that tables scroll horizontally on small screens
   - Verify charts adapt to smaller viewport
   - Test touch interactions for filters

4. **Performance Testing**
   ```
   Test Scenarios:
   □ Small dataset (1 month, 1 territory)
   □ Medium dataset (3 months, all territories)
   □ Large dataset (12 months, all data)
   ```

### 🐛 Common Issues to Check
- **Missing Data**: Verify your filters aren't too restrictive
- **Slow Loading**: Consider limiting date ranges for large datasets
- **Chart Errors**: Ensure chart data fields contain valid numbers
- **Mobile Issues**: Check that all elements fit on small screens

### 📱 Mobile Testing Checklist
