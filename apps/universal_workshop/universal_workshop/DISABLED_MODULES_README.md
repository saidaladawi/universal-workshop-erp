# Disabled Modules - Universal Workshop ERP

## Emergency Stabilization - July 1, 2025

The following modules have been temporarily disabled due to incomplete implementation:

### 1. mobile_technician (PERMANENTLY REMOVED)
**Status**: Removed on July 1, 2025
**Reason**: Redundant - functionality covered by existing modules
**Alternatives**: 
- Use `mobile_operations` module for mobile device management
- Use `workshop_operations/technician` for core technician functionality
- Use technician mobile assets in `/public/js/workshop/technician-*`

### 2. dark_mode (COMPLETED & RE-ENABLED)
**Status**: Completed on July 1, 2025
**Reason**: Full implementation added with CSS, JavaScript, and integration
**Files Added**: 
- `dark_mode.css` (7,782 bytes) - Complete dark theme styles
- `dark_mode.js` (10,998 bytes) - Full toggle and preference functionality
- Integrated in hooks.py and modules.txt
- Assets built and ready for production

## Summary of Actions Taken

### ✅ mobile_technician: PERMANENTLY REMOVED
- **Decision**: Remove permanently due to redundant functionality
- **Reason**: Existing modules already cover all technician mobile needs

### ✅ dark_mode: COMPLETED & PRODUCTION READY  
- **Decision**: Complete implementation and re-enable
- **Implementation**: Added full CSS/JS functionality with system integration
