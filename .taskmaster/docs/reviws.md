### 4.2 Critical Hooks Assessment

#### 4.2.1 ✅ Properly Configured Hooks
```python
# Boot and startup hooks
boot_session = "universal_workshop.boot.get_boot_info"  # ✅ Working
startup = ["universal_workshop.boot.check_initial_setup"]  # ✅ Working

# Website routes  
website_route_rules = [...]  # ✅ Properly configured

# Asset inclusion
app_include_css = [...]  # ✅ 11 CSS files included
app_include_js = [...]   # ✅ 20+ JS files included
```

#### 4.2.2 ❌ Problematic Hooks
```python
# Installation hooks (DISABLED)
# after_install = [...]  # ❌ Commented out - setup issues

# Missing DocType references
doc_events = {
    "Service Order": {...},     # ❌ DocType doesn't exist
    "Service Appointment": {...}, # ❌ DocType doesn't exist  
    "Workshop Technician": {...}, # ❌ DocType doesn't exist
    "Parts Usage": {...}        # ❌ DocType doesn't exist
}

# Broken API references
override_whitelisted_methods = {

5. User authentication ✅
6. Dashboard redirect ✅
```

### 5.2 Startup Issues Identified
- **License Validation Failure**: Missing license_management modules
- **Workshop Profile Missing**: Referenced but DocType not found
- **Permission System Incomplete**: Many permission hooks reference missing DocTypes
