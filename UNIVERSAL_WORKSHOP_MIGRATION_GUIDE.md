## 🔄 **Migration Mapping**

### **Key File Migrations:**

#### **Core System Files:**
- `install.py` → `setup/installation/installation_manager.py`
- `boot.py` → `core/boot/boot_manager.py`
- Workshop setup logic → Consolidated in installation manager

#### **Frontend Assets:**
- `public/js/*.js` → `assets/js/[category]/*.js`
- `public/css/*.css` → `assets/css/[category]/*.css`
- `hooks.py` → Updated with organized asset paths

#### **DocType Organization:**
- Workshop DocTypes → `workshop_operations/`
- System DocTypes → `system_administration/`
- Mobile DocTypes → `mobile_operations/`
- Setup DocTypes → `setup/`

---

## 🎯 **Key Improvements Achieved**

### **Code Organization:**
1. **Eliminated Duplication** - 3 setup systems → 1 unified system
2. **Clear Separation** - Logical functional grouping
3. **Improved Maintainability** - Easier navigation and updates
4. **Better Performance** - Optimized imports and structure

### **Asset Management:**
1. **Organized Structure** - Assets grouped by functionality
2. **Improved Loading** - Better browser caching
3. **Easier Maintenance** - Clear file organization
4. **Scalability** - Easy to add new assets

### **Development Workflow:**
1. **Faster Development** - Clear structure speeds feature development
2. **Better Testing** - Organized tests by module
3. **Easier Debugging** - Clear separation of concerns
4. **Team Collaboration** - Intuitive structure for team members

## 🛠️ **Post-Migration Operations**

### **For Developers:**

#### **New Import Patterns:**
```python
# OLD (deprecated):
from universal_workshop.install import after_install
from universal_workshop.boot import get_boot_info

# NEW (current):
from universal_workshop.setup.installation.installation_manager import after_install
from universal_workshop.core.boot.boot_manager import get_boot_info
```

#### **Asset References:**
```python
# hooks.py now uses organized structure:
app_include_js = [
    "/assets/universal_workshop/js/core/setup_check.js",
    "/assets/universal_workshop/js/branding/theme_manager.js",
    # ... organized by category
]
```

### **For System Administrators:**
1. **Backup Procedures** - Same as before, new structure is transparent
2. **Update Processes** - Follow new directory structure
3. **Monitoring** - New system_administration module provides better tools
