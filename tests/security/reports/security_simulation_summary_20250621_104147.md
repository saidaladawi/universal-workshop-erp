## Identified Vulnerabilities

### 1. Missing Rate Limiting (MEDIUM)

**Description:** API endpoints lack rate limiting protection against abuse

**Location:** All API endpoints

**Remediation:** Implement rate limiting (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user)


## Compliance Assessment

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)

**Status:** COMPLIANT

**Details:** Data minimization, encryption, and user consent mechanisms in place

**Recommendations:**
- Implement data retention policies
- Add data export functionality
- Regular privacy impact assessments


## Security Framework Validation

‚úÖ **Security Testing Framework Operational**

The comprehensive security testing framework is ready for:
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Input validation and injection testing
- API security assessment
- Data protection validation
- Compliance verification

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Address any identified vulnerabilities based on severity
2. Implement missing security headers and configurations
3. Enable rate limiting for API endpoints
4. Configure SSL/TLS for production deployment

### Ongoing Security Practices
1. Regular security assessments (quarterly)
2. Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
3. Security training for development team
4. Penetration testing (annually)
5. Security monitoring and incident response

### Production Deployment Checklist
